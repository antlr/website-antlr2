    We
    reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public domain. An individual or
    company may do whatever they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the code
    generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into commerical
    software.

    <p>We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask that
    credit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By &quot;credit&quot;, we mean that if you use
    ANTLR or incorporate any source code into one of your programs (commercial product,
    research project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the
    documentation, research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed a nice tool
    with the output, please mention that you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask
    that the headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these guidelines are kept,
    we expect to continue enhancing this system and expect to make other tools available as
    they are completed.
