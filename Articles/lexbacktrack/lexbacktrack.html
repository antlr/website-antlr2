<p>ANTLR supports large finite and, in fact, infinite lookahead (via
syntactic predicates), which means that even lexers can do some fairly
interesting things. In this field guide entry, my goal is to
demonstrate the effectiveness of syntactic predicates for lexing while
solving a useful problem at the same time.

<h3>Parsing HTML &lt;form&gt; Data</h3>

<p>
How many times have you wanted to build a quick form page for data
entry on the Web and then parse that tag/value pairs coming in to do
something useful?  I often use the email rather than cgi-bin action
for &lt;form&gt; tags because I can move the page anywhere without having to
wonder about the particular host's cgi-bin mechanism.  I have built a
tool that creates an HTML page echoing back the tag/value pairs.  The
tool also generates an index.html file listing every HTML file created
from the previous tool invocations.  The output of the tool is a page
that looks like:

<p>
<hr>
<font face="Arial"><table border=0>
<tr>
<td valign=top width=175>
<b>Company</b>
</td>
<td width=400>
BigCo<br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top width=175>
<b>salesperson</b>
</td>
<td width=400>
Eric<br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top width=175>
<b>instructor</b>
</td>
<td width=400>
Wile E. Coyote<br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top width=175>
<b>techcontact</b>
</td>
<td width=400>
Johnboy<br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top width=175>
<b>techcontactphone</b>
</td>
<td width=400>
555-2772<br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top width=175>
<b>shipaddress</b>
</td>
<td width=400>
Johnboy<br>232 Oak St<br>San Francisco CA 94666<br></td>
</tr>
</table>
</font>
<hr>

<p>
The output index.html file would link to this page.

<p>My first thought was to use PERL for this, but I quickly found that
no line-oriented tool could handle this problem easily because it
would constantly have to maintain state or mode information--ick! My
ANTLR solution uses 1 character of finite lookahead and backtracking
(arbitrary lookahead).</p>

<p>Take a look at the type of input you get from an HTML form that has
been emailed to you:</p>

<tt><pre>Company=BigCo
salesguy=Eric
instructor=Wile E Coyote
</pre></tt>

<p>These field and value pairs come from text fields in the HTML
form. So far, this problem just screams for an AWK or PERL
solution. However, when you consider text areas, you get the following
kind of data:</p>

<tt><pre>
address=1000 Washington Ave
NYC NY 94123
</pre></tt>

<p>This does not seem like a problem until you realize that the
newline character is no longer the end of &quot;value&quot;
delimiter. In fact the start of the next field looks like part of the
address data:</p>

<tt><pre>address=1000 Washington Ave
NYC NY 94123
phone=201 555 1212
</pre></tt>

<h3>Recognizing Tags Versus Values</h3>

<p>The question is: how you get the lexer to stop consuming input for
the address before the 'p' of &quot;phone&quot;? The answer is that
you have to scan way ahead to see the '='. Because ANTLR only allows
you to have syntactic predicates in rules with more than one
alternative, you cannot create a rule such as:</p>

<tt><pre>
TAG : ( TAG '=' ) =&gt; TAG '=' ;
</pre></tt>

<p>You must create a rule that specifies the difference between a tag
and a value:</p>

<tt><pre>
FORMTOKEN
    :   ( TAG '=' ) =&gt; TAG '='!     {$setType(TAG);}
    |   .                           {$setType(CHAR);}
    ;

// rule protected because only want it seen by FORMTOKEN
// not by nextToken
protected
TAG :   ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'0'..'9')+
    ;
</pre></tt>

<p>
FORMTOKEN returns a character rather than a string for the elements
of a value token because it is hard to write a (...)* loop that
knows to stop when it sees a valid tag coming down the road. For
example, the following rule stops only after it has seen the equal
rather than the tag before the equal, which is not what we want.</p>

<tt><pre>
VALUE : (~'=')+ ; // bad: scarfs past tags.
</pre></tt>

<p>On the other hand, as you can see, it is quite easy to do the
inverse: testing for the special case of a valid tag, leaving
everything else as part of a value token.</p>

<p>The parser for form data is straightforward:</p>

<tt><pre>
data
{
    String s;
}
    :   ( TAG s=string )+
    ;

string returns [String s]
{
    s=null;
    StringBuffer sbuf = new StringBuffer();
}
    :   (   c:CHAR
            {sbuf.append(c.getText());}
        )+
        {s=sbuf.toString();}
    ;
</pre></tt>

<h3>Translating Tag/Value Pairs to HTML</h3>

<p>In order to do the translation of tag/value pairs to HTML, we need
to embed actions within the grammar. As a general design principal it
is often a good idea to pass in a so-called behavior object with
methods that perform the actual work. You are able to use this grammar
for multiple translators in this manner (you can even change the
behavior at parse-time). Three behavior functions are sufficient for
this example: enter(), dataPair(), and exit():</p>

<tt><pre>
data
{
    String s;
    behavior.enter();
}
    :   (   t:TAG s=string
            {behavior.dataPair(t.getText(), s);}
        )+
        {behavior.exit();}
    ;
</pre></tt>

<p>where behavior is of type FormDataBehavior:</p>

<tt><pre>
public interface FormDataBehavior {
  public void dataPair(String tag, String value); // another tag/value
  public void enter();
  public void exit();
}
</pre></tt>

<p>To specify the translation, it suffices to provide an
implementation of this interface. I have provided an implementation
called BuildPageIndex, that uses Serialization to maintain an index
of HTML files generated by the separate invocations of the
program. The index.html file is regenerated for each invocation of
the program and a file called index.objects is the serialization
of my vector of label/URL pairs.  The code is fairly obvious, but the
important points are that:</p>

<ul>
<li>You must pass in a label which is used as the entry in the index page that is generated.

<li>You can pass in a hash table of tag translations. For example
you may want tag &quot;Company&quot; to appear as &quot;Which
Company?&quot; In the resulting HTML page representing the form data.
</ul>
