I have added a very decent ANSI C front end (only problem that I know of is
that it doesn't handle K&R style function headers; ack...just found
a few others, but I'll fix 'em).  See ansi.tar.

The C++ grammar has been significantly enhanced. version is now 1.1
(original was 1.0).  It now compiles correctly with 1.32b7 and uses
token object garbage collection.  The "real" C++ grammar is
done now by John Lilley.  See http://www.empathy.com/pccts/

The java.g grammar is 1.0.2 and hacks threw all the 1.0.2 source code.

The Browser32.zip contains win32 pccts, java parser, and browser that
integrates with the parser.
