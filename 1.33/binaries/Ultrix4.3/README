Okay, these are the binaries for antlr, dlg, genmk and sor for Ultrix 4.3.
These binaries were built on a DECstation 5000/200 using gcc-2.5.8.  The
command line I used was `make CC=gcc'.  *Use at own risk* and don't forget 
to thank Terence Parr for the wonderful toolkit he has contributed in the 
public domain.
