                       January 1, 1995


These packages were assembled by David Seidel (75342.2043@compuserve.com or
dseidel@delphi.com).  Any questions can be posted to the PCCTS newsgroup
(comp.compilers.tools.pccts) or via email.

Terence Parr just put pcctsw32.zip up, which is known to work on NT/95.
March 12, 1997.

To decode the ".zip" files, use PKUNZIP.EXE or UNZIP.EXE.  If you have neither
one, grab UNZIP.EXE from this directory.

There are three sets of binaries here: one for 32-bit MS-DOS built with the
djgpp port of gcc, one for 32-bit MS-DOS built with Borland C++ (bcc) 4.02
with the DOS PowerPak, and one for Windows NT console (Intel machines) built
with Microsoft Visual C++ 2.0.  This chart will tell you files you need
depending on which package you want.

   Platform       Files             Contents
   --------       -----             --------
   DOS (gcc)      pcctsgcc.zip      PCCTS executables
                  gccbin.zip        djgpp extender binaries

   DOS (bcc)      pcctsbcc.zip      PCCTS executables
                  bccbin.zip        Borland extender binaries

   NT             pcctsnt.zip       PCCTS executables

Note that the gcc and bcc packages each require a support file.  I've put them
into separate files because PCCTS generally gets updated faster than the
compilers do :-).

Have fun,
Dave
