    SED and AWK are great tools bestowed upon us from the great Uncle UNIX.&nbsp; They
    have one serious limitation, however: the tools are line-oriented and cannot handle simple
    translation problems for structured files like HTML.&nbsp; Consider performing an
    operation on the file names in &lt;IMG&gt; tags.&nbsp; The minute a tag spans more than
    one line, AWK and SED break down.<p>ANTLR 2.5.0 introduced an AWK-like lexical filtering
    mode that forces generated lexers to ignore any characters that do not match a lexical
    rule exactly.&nbsp; To turn ANTLR into SED, all you have to do is make a lexical filter
    rule that prints out the characters that don't match anything.&nbsp; Then, it's up to the
    lexical rules to generate what they want.</p>
    <p>Consider the following contrived example that turns &lt;br&gt; and &lt;p&gt; tags into
    their uppercase equivalents and dumps anything other than those tags to standard output:</p>
    <pre>class T extends Lexer;
options {
  k=2;
  filter=IGNORE;
  charVocabulary = '\3'..'\177';
} </pre>
    <pre>P : &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;  {System.out.print(&quot;&lt;P&gt;&quot;);};
BR: &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot; {System.out.print(&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;);}; </pre>
    <pre>protected IGNORE
  : ( &quot;\r\n&quot; | '\r' | '\n' )
    {newline(); System.out.println(&quot;&quot;);}
  | c:. {System.out.print(c);}
  ;</pre>
    <p>Rather than have a &quot;filter=sed&quot; option, it is simple enough to use this
    idiom: put a print statement in a filter rule.</td>
