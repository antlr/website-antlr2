A whitepaper that advocates hand-written code for walking an AST rather than using

</p><h2>Introduction</h2>
In an article titled <a href="http://antlr.org/article/1100569809276/use.tree.grammars.tml">
Translators Should Use Tree Grammars</a>
(hereafter, "the article"), Terence Parr makes the case for using a technology
called "Tree Grammars" for translation. In this article, I will take the opposing view
and explain why I believe that manually walking an AST is a better solution than
Tree Grammars.

<p>
To a large degree, how you want to design some AST transformation code is a matter of taste.
If you're the type of person who likes to look at some example code first, you're in luck!
We have two sets of example code, each of which simply walks through an AST and prints it out
as nicely formated Java code. We have <a href="http://jazillian.com/articles/java.tree.g">the "Tree Grammar" approach</a>
in ANTLR and Java syntax by Terence Parr. And we have the <a href="http://jazillian.com/articles/JavaEmitter.java">
the "plain AST walker" approach</a> by Andy Tripp.
</p><p>
If you don't want to go into too much detail and skip all the mumbo-jumbo, 
you may want to just compare those two and
decide for yourself which one you prefer.
</p><p>
...Now, on to the mumbo-jumbo...

</p><h2>Starting Points</h2>
The article starts with this simple statement: <i>One of the most
common questions programmers have when building a translator is, 'what do I do with my AST
now that I've built it?'".</i> I think it's more appropriate to take a step back and
use a different starting point.
<p>
When someone is building a language translator, having an AST and wondering what to do with it
is not a reasonable starting point. Rather, a reasonable starting point is having a set of
requirements; a fairly detailed description of needs to be done in order to perform
the translation, 

<table align="right" bgcolor="#ffff99" border="1" width="30%"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><font size="+1"><b>
Start with requirements for translation.</b></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

and wondering how to implement it. For example, a
C-to-Java translator might start with something like this:
<a href="http://www.jazillian.com/how.html">How to Convert C to Java</a> as a requirement,
and the developer's job is to write software that does all that automatically.
</p><p>
What difference does the starting point make? 
Well, these are more than two different mindsets, they are also two different approaches.
On the one hand, the approach is "Let's do as much as we can with the AST". The other
approach is "We must do all of the things in our requirements, and we'll leverage the AST as best we can."
And so the two approaches will likely lead us to two different solutions. The goal of language
translation is not "What to do with this AST?", it's "What's the best way to do all those things in
that huge list above?" Starting with this second goal, you may never even want to have
an AST, as I argue in 
<a href="http://antlr.org/article/1136917339929/stringTemplate.html">another article</a>.
But for the purposes of this paper, I'll assume that you have chosen to use ASTs as the
basis for your language translation tool.
</p><p>
The point here is that we should not approach the problem with an AST in hand, wondering
how to best traverse it, but rather that we have a set of given requirements that we need
to implement and an AST in hand, and where should we go from here? One solution may be
to simply walk the AST, but more likely, when we look in detail at our requirements, we'll
find that we'll need to do many walks of the AST, we may need to do some
very complex searching and manipulation of the AST, we may need multiple ASTs as well as
other data structures, and so on.
</p><p>
So it may be more complex than simply walking the AST once, so what? Good question. Just
to give one example, if we have to walk the tree many times, doing transformations in
each pass, the whole idea of what it means to "validate the tree structure" becomes very complex. So if one
strategy has the advantage that it "validates the tree structure", we'll now have to wonder
if that's even something that's possible or desirable. More generally, we need to approach
the problem with a firm grasp on the real-world complexities that we need to solve. That way,
we won't come up with solution that seem very simple on the surface (e.g. "be sure to
initialize variables at their declaration...") but turn out to be devilishly complex
in reality ("...but only if control flow analysis shows that we need to.").
</p><p>
Anyway, we've got a set of requirements for our language translator. We've decided to
ignore my 
<a href="http://antlr.org/article/1136917339929/stringTemplate.html">advice</a>
 and architect it around the idea of AST manipulation. We've used a lexer and parser to build
our AST. Now what?

</p><h2>Visitors</h2>
The first approach that the article suggests is to use a "generic depth-first-tree walker"
which uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">Visitor design pattern</a>.
As you can see from my <a href="http://jazillian.com/articles/JavaEmitter.java">JavaEmitter.java</a> example,
I prefer the "just write some generic AST-walking code" approach, either with
or without the use of the visitor pattern. And so I'll try to debunk the article's claims
that there are problems with this approach.

<table align="right" bgcolor="#ffff99" border="1" width="30%"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><font size="+1"><b>
The "Manually walk the AST" approach may or may not involve the Vistor pattern.</b></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>
First, let me just outline what it is we're talking about here. In this approach, we simply
write some generic code in, say, Java, that traverses a tree. It may involve use of the Visitor
pattern, but doesn't have to. Here is some code that does not use it:
</p><pre>void walk(AST ast) {
	switch(ast.getType()) {
		case Types.PACKAGE_DEF:
			print("package ");
			walk(ast.getFirstChild());
			print(";\n\n");
			break;
		case Types.IMPORT:
			print("import ");
			walk(ast.getFirstChild());
			print(";");
			break;
		case Types.CLASS_DEF:
			walk(getChild(ast, MODIFIERS));
			print("class ");
			walk(getChild(ast, IDENT));
			print(" ");
			walk(getChild(ast, EXTENDS_CLAUSE));
			walk(getChild(ast, IMPLEMENTS_CLAUSE));
			startBlock();
			walk(getChild(ast, OBJBLOCK));
			endBlock();
			break;

       // ...handle every other possible node type in the AST...
	}
}
</pre>
Here, for example, when we encounter a "PACKAGE_DEF" node in our AST, we print out
"package ", then print the first child of the AST (via a recursive call to walk()), 
and then print ";" and a couple of
newline characters.
 
<p>
The article lists three problems with visitors:
<i>
</i></p><ol>
<li><i>tree structure is not validated
</i></li><li><i>actions execute without convenient context information
</i></li><li><i>inconvenient data passing between actions
</i></li></ol>

Let's examine each of these in detail.

<h3>Tree Structure Validation</h3>
First, we have the supposed disadvantage that the tree structure is not validated. 
The article says <i>"A generic visitor walks a tree totally ignoring structural constraints"</i>.
I suppose that depends on how you implement it, but as you can see from the code above,
you can certainly implement it so that there are many validations. 
The code above, for example, will produce an
error if a PACKAGE_DEF node in the AST has no children. 
<p>
On the other hand, if we look at the CLASS_DEF processing in the code above, we see that
it apparently will not check the order of the children nodes (e.g. that any MODIFIERS
child comes first). And with a little effort, we could tell that this code:
</p><pre>walk(getChild(ast, IDENT));
</pre>
Is not actually requiring that the CLASS_DEF node have a IDENT child.
<p>
So this code is really doing only <b>some</b> tree structure validation...just about as much
as it needs to in order to do its job.
Is that really a
disadvantage? 
</p><p>
Let's take a step back and look at the normal chain of events for a typical compiler:
</p><p><b>
preprocessor --&gt; lexer ---&gt; parser  --&gt; code generator --&gt; assembler --&gt; linker
</b></p><p>
Our translator probably will be very similar, something like:
</p><p><b>
preprocessor --&gt; lexer ---&gt; parser --&gt; AST transformer --&gt; prettyprinter
</b></p><p>
Looking at the compiler steps and all the existing compilers out there, how much
input validation does each step do, and
what is the result? The answer is that in general, all steps do some sort of
validation of their input as part of their normal course of processing. But none really
"goes out of it's way" to attempt to completely verify the integrity of its input. The parser assumes that
the stream of tokens it got from the lexer is valid, the code generator assumes that
the AST produced by the parser is valid, and so on.
</p><p>
So looking at the chain for our translator, do we really need or even want our
"AST Transformer" step to be doing any extra work to validate that the parser produced
a valid AST? The answer, to me, is a clear "no".

<table align="right" bgcolor="#ffff99" border="1" width="30%"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><font size="+1"><b>
We don't need each step to completely validate its input.</b></font></td></tr></tbody></table>


 None of the other steps are doing that sort
of thing. And doing so would mean that we're duplicating code and effort...the concept of
"what is a valid AST" would then be implemented in both the parser <b>and</b> the "AST transformer"
phases. We no more want the AST transformer double-checking that the parser produced a valid
AST than we'd want our parser to be double-checking that the
lexer produced a valid token stream. The parser leaves the lexing to the lexer, and assumes
that what it got is correct. The AST transformer should leave the parsing to the parser and
assume that the AST is correct.
</p><p>

<a name="context"></a>
</p><h3>Context Information</h3>
The second supposed drawback of using visitors is that
<i>"actions execute without convenient context information"</i>. The article gives an example where
you are dealing with a subexpression, and you need to know whether you're inside a
"while" statement or whether you're inside an assignment statement. It points out that
we must walk up the AST and then points out the drawback:
<p> 
<i>Aside from making your actions dependent on the physical structure of the tree, 
manually looking upwards is extremely inconvenient and very inefficient.</i>
</p>
As for depending on the physical structure of the AST, there's simply no getting around
that. If you're going to do one thing when below a WHILE node, and something else when
below an ASSIGN node, you're by definition depending on the physical structure of the tree.
You may take the approach of building up some data structure and passing it around, but that's
still depending on the structure of the tree. There's nothing wrong with depending on the
physical structure of the AST. In fact, that's what our "AST Transformer" - the heart of
our translator - does for a living. It massages the tree based on its structure.
<p>
So I don't see how TreeWalker approach somehow gives you context information
"for free". If we look at the <a href="http://jazillian.com/articles/java.tree.g">java.tree.g</a> example which uses
the TreeWalker approach to print a Java AST, we see many calls to getFirstChild() and
getNextSibling() every time we need context information - information about children
of the current AST node. We also see methods such as indent(), undent(), and nl(), which
are written in Java, and preserve context information (how much we are currently indented
and whether the last output was a newline or not). I can find nothing in that java.tree.g
that "looks up the tree" or uses information that was passed down during the walk.
</p><p>
So rather than this example showing how the TreeWalker approach provides context information
for free, it only shows that this example is simple enough not to need it.
 
</p><p>
As for looking upwards being inconvenient and inefficient, this would only be true if you've
done a poor job of designing your AST data structure. 

<table align="right" bgcolor="#ffff99" border="1" width="20%"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><font size="+1"><b>
Walking up the tree is fast and easy.</b></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

If each AST node has a pointer to
its parent node, this will be extremely efficient, and trivial to develop. For
example, to search up the tree for a node of a given type:
</p><pre>class MyAST {
	boolean searchUp(int type) {
	   if (this.type == type) return true;
	   if (getParent() == null) return false;
	   return getParent().searchUp(type);
	}
}
</pre>

<h3>Data Passing</h3>
The third supposed drawback of visitors is <i>"inconvenient data passing between actions"</i>.
And the explanation is this:
<p>
<i>Node actions may compute data needed by future actions. 
Because each action is isolated..., you cannot use the usual programming constructs 
like local variables, parameters, and return values to pass information</i>
</p><p>
Let's split "future actions" into two groups and deal with each group. One case is where
you save data during a tree walk for some "future action" that's <b>under</b> the current node in the tree.
There are several solutions here, none of which is inherently "bad". You could simply not
save any data, and look up the tree when you need to, as we showed in the previous section.
A second approach is to build up some stack-type data structure pushing when you step down the tree
and popping when you step up. And a third approach would be to have some sort of
non-local variable that stores this information. For example, you might maintain a
boolean "isUnderWhile" variable. Yes, these second two options are
 bit messy, and the "search up the tree as
needed" is almost certainly better. But the point is that there's no glaring problem here:
the AST has all the information that we need, and any use of parameters and return values
is probably not needed.
</p><p>
The other group of "future actions" is the case where some part of the AST affects some other part
that's not under it. For example, suppose we're analysing some AST node that represents
a function call and we want to search the AST for the function definition. Here again, we simply need
simple routines that would search the AST. No local variables, parameters, and return values
is going to help us with this situation no matter how we structure things.

<table align="right" bgcolor="#ffff99" border="1" width="15%"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><font size="+1"><b>
The AST *is* the context.</b></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
The article says <i>"You must use instance variables which are clumsy and violate 
data hiding principles."</i>.
A I said above, the response is "yes, you use the AST, which is an instance variable", but
that (assuming done reasonably) is not clumsy nor violate data hiding principles.



</p><p>
The article then goes on to explain that there's nothing inherently wrong with the visitor pattern
and the author is not biased against them, which I agree with completely. As a side note, it's
interesting to note that the original Design Patterns ("Gang Of Four") book actually uses
the walking of ASTs as it's example to illustrate the need for the Visitor Pattern.

</p><h2>Manual Tree Walkers</h2>
In its "Manual Tree Walkers" section the article outlines how one might walk the AST by having
a class for each AST node type and explicit code for walking the node like this:
<pre>class PlusNode extends ExprNode {
  ExprNode left;
  ExprNode right;
  public PlusNode(ExprNode left, ExprNode right) {...}
  public void walk() {
    left.walk();
    right.walk();
    ... plus node action ...
  }
</pre>
It is indeed a bit scary to think anyone might consider doing this by hand.
The only time you tend to see this kind of code these days is in a compiler book that is
showing you how you might do a parser by hand. This is in the chapter just before the one
that says "and now we will use a generator to generate all that, because no one would want
to write that by hand."
<p>
So I agree completely with the list of drawbacks given in the article:
<i>
</i></p><ol>
<li><i> action and tree structure walking code is entangled; you risk breaking action code when altering the walking code
</i></li><li><i> manually built tree walkers have no guarantee that their parsing logic is complete and consistent
</i></li><li><i> manually building tree walkers is much more laborious than the visitor pattern
</i></li></ol>

...with the additional note relating to the second item: no tree-walking strategy will ever guarantee that
our parsing logic is complete and consistent. But that's not the job of the tree-walker anyway, that's
the job of the parser that produced the AST.
<p>
And the article continues on to talk about the drawbacks of writing a treewalker "by hand".
 
<table align="right" bgcolor="#ffff99" border="1" width="30%"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><font size="+1"><b>
Generating lots of classes to do the walking is indeed a bad idea.</b></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

These are all
valid points, similar to the drawbacks of writing a parser "by hand". But, from what I can tell, these
points only address writing a treewalker by hand as opposed to using a generic treewalker (possibly
using a visitor pattern). It does not make any points about how a "Tree Grammar" would be better than
a generic treewalker.
</p><p>
In other words, the three drawbacks listed above do apply to a treewalker that's written
"by hand" and has a class for each node type. But it does not apply to a treewalker that's
written "by hand" that looks like the <a href="http://jazillian.com/articles/JavaEmitter.java">JavaEmitter code</a>
that I showed earlier - the one big switch statement
inside a walk() method. 

</p><h2>Tree Grammars</h2>
Try, if you dare, to really wrap your brain around the following statement from the article:
<p>
<i>I realized that tree parsing is identical to text parsing, albeit in two dimensions instead of one.</i>
</p><p>
Go ahead and take an few minutes, a few hours, or a full PhD program to really absorb that. I'll wait
right here....
</p><p>
...done? OK. Good. You see how parsing a linear stream of tokens is just like parsing a
tree data structure, but with one less dimension? If so, you're a better man than I am.
While I can see how they're a little analogous, I can't clearly see that they're really
"the same thing" in that I'd want to then use the same language and approach to do these two things.

<table align="right" bgcolor="#ffff99" border="1" width="40%"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><font size="+1"><b>
A great parser-generator language does not necessarily make a great tree-transformation language.</b></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

In the one case, we're taking a token stream as input and producing an AST as output, and
some BNF-like grammar (e.g. ANTLR or yacc syntax) with interspersed code is a great way
to do it, and that's how virtually everyone has done it for decades. This works well because
the BNF-like grammar looks so much like the output. The whole parser has boiled down to saying
"this is what the AST should look like".
</p><p>
In the other case,
we're taking an AST as input, and perhaps a different AST as output. Here, the situation
is not nearly as clear. The mapping from one AST structure to another is quite complex
(see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</a>, <a href="http://www.txl.ca/">TXL</a>, or <a href="http://treedl.sourceforge.net/about.html">TreeDL</a> for example),
and a single BNF-like grammar doesn't capture it.
</p><p>
In any case, let's get right to the supposed advantages of tree grammars over writing your own
code (visitor pattern and all that) that walks an AST. From the article:
<i>
</i></p><ol>
<li><i>terse, type-system independent, formal specification of the tree structure
</i></li><li><i>actions have implicit context by virtue of their location in the grammar
</i></li><li><i>unlike visitors, data can be passed around easily between actions using parameters, return values, and local variables
</i></li></ol>

<p>
As for the first item, we've covered this issue already. It's a formal specification
of the <b>input</b> AST structure, not any output. We don't want a complete
specification of the input tree structure in our AST-transformation phase. It's enough
for the phase to assume that the previous phase (the parser) is doing its job correctly,
just as all phases do. Having a complete specification here is actually harmful, because
now we have that same "specification" in two places: one is the heart of the parser, and the
second is here at the start of the transformer.
Yes, certainly we'll have to deal with
error cases in our AST-transformation phase if it gets an AST that it can't handle. But I really
don't want to have anything like a complete specification of the AST structure - that's the parser's job.
</p><p>
As for the second item: <i>"actions having explicit context by virtue of the 
location in the grammar"</i>...obviously this
makes no sense to me since I don't even want the grammar here. We also covered this earlier
under <a href="#context">"Context Information"</a>. 
</p><p>
This idea of "having explicit context" goes to what we said earlier about instance variables.
In my view, the AST <b>is</b> the context. We are in the midst of walking an AST, and if
we want to find out our context, we simply look up the tree. There's no need for passing variables
and return values. And there's no need to have the code structure match the AST structure.
</p><p>
And the third issue <i>"data can be passed around easily between actions"</i>, is really the
same issue. I don't see a need to be passing around data, whether implicit ("context") or
explicit ("parameters"). Just use the AST itself.  

</p><h2>The Disadvantages Of Tree Grammars</h2>
I see the following as disadvantages of the Tree Grammar approach:
<ol>
<li>The need to know an additional language
</li><li>Mixing of languages
</li><li>Code structure matches input AST structure, not logical structure.
</li></ol>
The first two are closely related, but not identical. Obviously, if you're
going to use the "Tree Grammar" approach, you're going to need to know another
language, such as ANTLR. This may not be a big disadvantage if you already know
ANTLR syntax. Perhaps you even wrote your lexer and parser in ANTLR. But there
are also plenty of situations where you simply used an existing lexer and parser.
This is my personal situation, where I used the existing ANTLR C lexer and parser code.
<p>
I have always hated it when people mix two languages together, whether it's HTML and

<table align="right" bgcolor="#ffff99" border="1" width="30%"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><font size="+1"><b>
Mixing de langues es muy feo*
</b></font></td></tr></tbody></table>


CSS, Java and JSP, or whatever. It can be very difficult to "see the uglyness" of
two mixed languages when you know both languages well, so let me highlight it for you.
<a href="http://jazillian.com/articles/java.tree.color.g">Here</a> is the "Tree Grammar" which prints out a Java
AST, colored to distinguish between ANTLR syntax, Java syntax, and Java syntax which
requires knowledge of ANTLR. The sight of all these intermingled languages should make
you cringe.
</p><p>
If it doesn't, imagine an analogous situation.
Imagine trying to read about 10 pages of text, of which about 50%
is in English, 25% is in Spanish, and 25% is in a hybrid of English and Spanish.
</p><p>
Finally, and most important, is the issue of the structure of our AST transformation code.
Comparing the <a href="http://jazillian.com/articles/java.tree.g">"Tree Grammar" approach</a>
and the <a href="http://jazillian.com/articles/JavaEmitter.java">"by-hand walker" approach</a>, the crucial issue is
that the structure of the Tree Grammar approach matches the input AST structure. 
It essentially says "Here is what the AST looks like, and actions to print it out are embedded
within". Whereas the "by-hand" approach says "Here is how to print out each of the node types".
Which is the better way?
</p><p>
Well, at the risk of over-analyzing things... the question comes down to whether we really care
what the <b>overall</b> structure of the input AST is. Specifically, do we want our
AST-transformation phase to be tied tightly (to "look like", really) the AST structure
of the parser? In my opinion, the answer is "no". By not having the AST-transformer tightly
bound to the AST structure, it's easier to maintain, enhance, and modify to work
with other languages and AST structures.

<table align="right" bgcolor="#ffff99" border="1" width="30%"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><font size="+1"><b>
Structuring the code to match the input doesn't help anything.</b></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

Glancing at the "by-hand" code gives little clue as to the input AST structure, and I think that's
a good thing, because that way, it is less dependent on the input AST structure. For example,
all the node types that are binary operators are lumped together because they are all 
processed in the same way, and we don't care where they may appear in the AST.

</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>
The decision about whether to use a "Tree Grammar" approach to translation vs. just 
"doing it by hand" is a matter of taste. Let's look at an analogous situation
with natural languages. Suppose we have parsed some English sentence
and placed into a tree-like structure, as our 7th-grade teacher taught us.
And now, we'd like to write some code that converts that tree to an equivalent
"Spanish" tree. The big question is whether we want our code to look generally
like this:
<pre>Sentence : [Noun {Action}] 
           Verb {VerbAction}
           [DirectObject {DirectObjectAction}] 
           *(Conjunction {ConjunctionAction} Sentence) 
           EndPunctuation {EndPunctuationAction};
</pre>
...or do we want it to look like this...
<pre>switch (nodeType) {
	case Noun:
		nounAction;
		break;
	case Verb:
		VerbAction;
		break;
	case DirectObject:
		DirectObjectAction;
		break;
	case Conjunction:
		ConjunctionAction;
		break;
	case EndPunctuation:
		EndPunctuationAction;
		break;
}
</pre>
The first case is more terse and reflects the structure of the input, but is less readable
and mixes two languages (although we only see one language here, presumably we'll have to
embed some Java code as things get complicated).
<p>
I think the approach that you'll prefer depends on your background. If you're 
already intimately familiar with the ":", "[". "]", "*" , "{", "}", and ";" constructs
in the first approach, you will prefer the terse approach. On the other hand, if you
don't want to be bothered with all that "extra syntax", 
you'll prefer the more verbose "plain Java" approach.
</p><p>
Not sure which one you are? Well, I'll give you a hint. People who actually <b>like</b> dealing with
<table align="right" bgcolor="#ffff99" border="1" width="30%"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><font size="+1"><b>
*"Mixing of languages is very ugly"</b></font></td></tr></tbody></table>
"extra syntax" tend to be language junkies and language tool builders and tend to think in
terms of "I have an AST, now what should I do with it?". People who <b>don't like</b> dealing
with "extra syntax" tend to view the translation problem as "Here are all the things
I need to do in order to perform translation, what's the best way to go about it?"
