<h1><a name=_bb1>1.33-to-2.20 Conversion Tips</a></h1>

<p>I've been converting 1.33 grammars to 2.0 and thought I'd pass along the<br>
following tips that may help folks avoid some of the problems I've had doing<br>
it.&nbsp; I hope these tips help -- happy parsing!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Note that several of the EBNF notations have changed. In particular, the<br>
    optional clause &quot;{...}&quot;, has become &quot;(...)?&quot;. This new notation for<br>
    optional clauses conflicts with the old way to express syntactic predicates,<br>
    which have become &quot;(...)=&gt;&quot;. Because you'll probably have more optional<br>
    clauses than syntactic predicates, convert the optional clauses first, then<br>
    go back to your old grammar, find the syntactic predicates and change them<br>
    appropriately in the new grammar.</li>
  <li>Semantic actions are now delimited with &quot;{...}&quot; rather than the old-style<br>
    &quot;&lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt;&quot; notation. This is an easy replacement to make, as there
    are<br>
    probably few &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; shift operators in your old C++
    code, so you can<br>
    do a simple search-and-replace. Note that you should change optional<br>
    clauses from &quot;{...}&quot; to &quot;(...)?&quot; _before_ changing semantic action<br>
    delimiters, when the old optional clauses are still easy to distinguish from<br>
    the new semantic action delimiters.</li>
  <li>Probably the most challenging part of the conversion will be moving from<br>
    the DLG-based scanner to the LL(k) scanner. Most of the conversions are<br>
    quite mechanical, but some are not. In particular, you now have to address<br>
    left factoring in those productions of the scanner that will return tokens<br>
    to the parser.</li>
  <li>ANTLR is happiest when you use quoted strings directly in the grammar for<br>
    keywords. Under 1.33, I had defined all my keywords as lexical tokens<br>
    (using something like &quot;#token K_WORD &quot;keyword&quot;). Although doing this avoids<br>
    misspelling problems (e.g., using &quot;while&quot; in one place and &quot;whiel&quot;
    another),<br>
    ANTLR 2.x is best-suited to using literals directly in the grammar because<br>
    of the way it generates the token hash table, etc. in the resulting code.<br>
    Watch carefully for misspellings.</li>
  <li>There is no #tokenclass in ANTLR 2.x. The best way to handle such cases<br>
    appears to be to create a new production in the _parser_ that mimics the<br>
    old-style token class (e.g., changing &quot;#tokenclass SQLVerbs { K_SELECT,<br>
    K_DELETE, ...}&quot; to something like &quot;sqlVerbs : &quot;select&quot; |
    &quot;delete&quot; | ...&quot;).</li>
  <li>Handling numeric literals is more problematic in 2.x. In particular, if<br>
    you have a language that has &quot;similar&quot; literals (e.g., integers, reals,<br>
    dates, times, etc. as are present in a database-focused language), you'll<br>
    have more work to do in the LL(k) scanner environment. It appears easiest<br>
    to collect these literals into a single scanner production and either<br>
    left-factor or make use of syntactic predicates. You can set the token type<br>
    in each alternative using a specific semantic action in each disjunct of the<br>
    production (e.g., &quot;{ _ttype = NUM_FLOAT; }&quot;). (Note that if you use<br>
    the -diagnostic switch on antlr.Tool, the scanner's &quot;.txt&quot; file includes<br>
    what seem like spurious complaints about setting _ttype in this manner. The<br>
    warnings can apparently be safely ignored.) See the sample Java grammars<br>
    (particularly Scott's new one) for examples of how to do this type of thing.</li>
  <li>Use the &quot;protected&quot; flag on lexer rules that are only being used as<br>
    &quot;helpers&quot; (e.g., on a &quot;DIGIT&quot; production that's used in other lexer<br>
    productions for integers, floats, etc.). Not only does this make the<br>
    resulting method in the output protected, it is also used by ANTLR to modify<br>
    its test for ambiguous rules in the scanner, eliminating some<br>
    &quot;non-deterministic&quot; warnings. See examples of this in Scott's new Java<br>
    parser.</li>
  <li>When generating ASTs, it's often helpful to create &quot;dummy&quot; nodes that<br>
    have a token type that's used only to make AST traversal unambiguious (i.e.,<br>
    &quot;flag&quot; various subtrees so that the tree parser doesn't have to fool with<br>
    resolving ambiguous tree structures). Under 1.3x, such dummy token types<br>
    could be created using #token with no pattern (e.g., &quot;#token D_DUMMY&quot;).<br>
    Under 2.x, you can create dummy token types with a production that simply<br>
    has the dummy values as disjuncts (for example, &quot;dummyTokens : D_RED |<br>
    D_GREEN | D_BLUE;&quot;). Such a production will cause the tokens to be created,<br>
    added to the TokenTypes output and so on. You can then refer to the dummy<br>
    types in semantic actions used to build ASTs. Be sure NOT to refer to the<br>
    &quot;dummyTokens&quot; production elsewhere in your grammar!</li>
  <li>Make use of the &quot;-diagnostic&quot; flag on antlr.Tool. The &quot;.txt&quot; output
    for<br>
    your parser(s) and scanner(s) are very helpful in diagnosing conflicts and<br>
    ambiguities. Using the txt files in conjunction with the ANTLR output<br>
    itself is the easiest way to figure out which alternatives are conflicting<br>
    with which when there are ambiguities. Note that when the ANTLR output<br>
    refers to &quot;line 0&quot;, it's really talking about the &quot;nextToken&quot;
    function, the<br>
    alternatives for which will appear first in the scanner txt file.<br>
