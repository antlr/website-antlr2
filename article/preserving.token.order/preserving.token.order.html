<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>


<P>One of the most common translation task is to read some input, augment
it, and spit it back out with the original format.  For example, you
may want to read in Java, add some instrumentation method calls, and
spit the same program back out.  Currently, there is no obvious means
of doing this simply in ANTLR.  I have conjured up an experimental
means of supporting x to x translation without modifying ANTLR itself.
This example provides modified token, token stream, tree node, and ast
factory objects along with a simple grammar to demonstrate their use.
The grammar describes a simple calculator language and builds the
usual ASTs.  There is also a tree walker grammar that asks a few of
the operator nodes to print out the tokens, in original order, that
were matched for that operation (as opposed to the tokens matched for
the parser rule that matched that operation).

<P>This experiment is not perfect.  For example, I have not bothered to
figure out how to handle whitespace or tokens w/o nodes (SEMI) that
occur in between statements.  The token stream tracks everything, but
when I walk the trees to print, for example, all nodes associated
with an assignment except the SEMI are printed; SEMI is not added to
the tree even though it is parsed.  Clearly, one only has to look at
the tokens stored by the token stream after the end of one statement
and before the start of the next statement.  Exercise for the
reader. ;) If someone wants to extend this, please do so and post at
ANTLR.org or send to me. :)
<H2>WHY IS THIS HARD IN ANTLR?</H2>


<P>The problem comes down to the types of trees ANTLR encourages you to
build: ASTs (ANTLR) versus parse trees.  A parse tree encodes the
rules used to match some input and has tokens at the leaves with rule
nodes as subtree roots.  In contrast, an AST consists only of token
nodes where subtree roots are taken to be operators.  For example,
given input "3+4" the parse tree might look like:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
      expr
        |
     addExpr
    /      \
  atom  +  atom
   |        |
   3        4
</PRE></FONT>



<P>whereas the AST would look like:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
  +
 / \
3   4
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Clearly, the parse tree is sensitive to changes in the grammar by
definition.  More importantly, the rule nodes are noise really.  It is
better from a tree walker perspective to have trees where the
structure encodes the relationship between tokens without all the rule
nodes getting in the way.  An AST is sort of a canonical form that is
insensitive to changes in the way you express your grammar.
Regardless of how you express a grammar, the AST could always remain
the same.

<P>So ASTs are what you want from a translation point of view, but they
have one big disadvantage: the order of the original token stream is
not preserved.  With a parse tree, you can simply walk the leaves in a
depth-order traversal and you're done.  An AST specifically moves
tokens out of order.  There is no well-defined order traversal for an
AST that will print out the tokens in the original order.
<H2>A SOLUTION</H2>


<P>The first solution that came to mind was tracking the index of the
first and last token associated with every node and its children.  So,
for example, the "+" operator subtree root would track the min/max
index for itself and all children.  This min/max definition is
inductive (recursive) with the overall root node having min..max of
0..n-1 where n is the number of tokens in the input stream.

<P>This solution is nice because it doesn't matter how you build the
trees--root nodes always can spit out all tokens for itself and below
in the right order.  For example, "<TT>a+b*c</TT>" would look like the
following, partially annotated with min..max token index:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
  + 0..4
 / \
a   * 2..4
   / \
  b   c 4..4
</PRE></FONT>



<P>The identifier nodes have min=max=tokenIndex; so, node "a" has 0..0
and "c" has 4..4.

<P>To print out just the multiplication, you would print from tokens 2 to
4 from the overall list of tokens you've tracked.

<P>What about whitespace (this extends to comments, of course)?  Consider
"<TT>a + b </TT>".  The token list is

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
index: 0  1  2    3  4  5
token: ID WS PLUS WS ID WS
</PRE></FONT>



<P>and the tree is

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
  + 0..4
 / \
a   b
</PRE></FONT>



<P>So printing tokens associated with the "+" gets you "<TT>3 + 4</TT>", missing
the final whitespace.  I left my solution like this as I was not sure
how I wanted to handle inter-expression whitespace etc...

<P>If you have two expressions like "<TT>a+b; c+d</TT>" then you'd get an AST like
this:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
  0..3    5..7
  +-------+
 / \     / \
a   b   c   d
</PRE></FONT>



<P>where the token list is:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
index: 0  1    2  3    4  5  6    7
token: ID PLUS ID SEMI WS ID PLUS ID
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Again, the SEMI is not added to the tree, but is parsed and is tracked
in the list of tokens.  In other words, the information is available,
but I did not incorporate it into my subsequence printing routines.
<H2>IMPLEMENTATION</H2>

<OL>
<LI>The first thing you need is a way to track the entire list of
   tokens in order.  TokenStream objects are natural way to do this.
   I made a TokenStream (filter) that fits between the lexer and
   parser to track every token.  I also made sure my "calculator"
   example lexer didn't skip and throw out whitespace; the
   TokenStreamTracker needs to see these too.  This object then can
   filter out tokens not useful to the parser after recording them.
   The block box diagram looks like this:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
character stream 
       |
       v
  [CalcLexer]
       |
 token stream of TokenWithIndex objects
       |
       v
[TokenStreamTracker]
       |
token stream missing whitespace
       |
       v
  [CalcParser]
       |
      AST (tracking min/max index values) ASTMinMax objects
       |
       v
[CalcTreeWalker]
</PRE></FONT>


</LI>
<LI>The next thing you need is an AST node that tracks min/max:
   ASTMinMax.  To get the min/max numbers, you need a Token object
   (TokenWithIndex) that tracks its index (sequence number) so that
   the AST.initialize(Token) method can set min/max.
</LI>
<LI>Lastly, you must alter the standard ASTFactory (subclass to make
   TrackerASTFactory object) so that subtree roots get their min/max
   values updated as children are added.  While inefficient, the
   following recursive min/max are obvious and work without having to
   modify ANTLR in any way.<BR>
<BR>
	  min(node) = min(node.children) <BR>
	  max(node) = max(node.children)
</LI>
