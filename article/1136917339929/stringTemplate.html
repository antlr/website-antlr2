<h1>Introduction</h1>
In <a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=77">
 Language Translation Using ANTLR and StringTemplate</a>, Terence Parr describes
 how the StringTemplate mechanism works by describing how it can be used to
 translate from one simple high-level language to three others. He calls the
 input language "C-", a simplified version of C, and there are actually three output languages:
Java, Python, and a simplified bytecode language.

 <p>
My  <a href="http://www.jazillian.com">Jazillian</a> C-to-Java translator takes
a different, rule-based approach. In this article, I'll attempt to justify my
approach by explaining why I think StringTemplate, and the AST-walking approach to
language translation in general, fall short.
     <p>
The StringTemplate article ends with this:
<p>
<i>While a real translator is much more complicated, it is only in the details.
The strategy described in this article will scale easily.</i>
<p>
I don't believe the StringTemplate approach scales well to the C-to-Java
case, and in fact a rule-based pattern-matching approach is a better approach
than the traditional "walk an AST" approach for C-to-Java.

<h1>Full Language Translation: Language and Libraries</h1>
Today, when we say that a program is "written in the high-level programming language X", we're
referring to more than just the language
syntax. We also mean that it uses the standard libraries that come with the language. Older languages
such as FORTRAN came with a very small set of libraries, languages like C came with medium sized
libraries, and newer languages such as Java and C# come with huge libraries.
<p>
So to really produce reasonable target code when translating from one high-level language to another,
we need to do not only transformations based on language syntax, but also the much
larger task of mapping library calls in the source language to equivalent library calls in the
target language. And, of course, there are many cases where we can translate core language code
into library call code (picture replacing various patterns of C code with a single call to
Java's String.indexOf(), for example).For the Jazillian C-to-Java translator, the vast majority of the work is in
converting the library calls, not the core language syntax.
I refer to this as producing "natural" Java code - code that looks hand-written.
Everything I say
here assumes that the goal really is to produce "natural" code.


<h1>The StringTemplate "Multiple Views" Advantage</h1>
The StringTemplate approach is to generate an intermediate data structure (the StringTemplate)
while walking the AST, and then potentially having multiple outputs for different languages,
and having those output formats clearly separated from the parsing and building of
the data structure. So we have a single C parser, and we add instructions for how
to build a StringTemplate within that parser spec (i.e. the C grammar). We then
have three separate "output specifications": one for Java, another for Python, and a third for bytecode.
<p>
This "separate the view in the MVC architecture" feature
is widely known. In fact, much of the Java (and SmallTalk and others) architecture is based on this design.
And the whole reason for the existence of CSS is to separate the "view" (the CSS)
from the "data" (the HTML).
But the main rationale for separating the "view" from the "controller" and "model" is so that
we can have multiple "views", and that we can easily change the "view" without having to touch
the "model" or the "controller.  Certain applications may have multiple "views"
(ANTLR, for example, which takes a single input in ANTLR-language,
but generates Java code for Java programmers, C code for
C programmers, etc). But for other applications, such as a "Any-dialect-of-C to Java" or
"C or C++ to Java", the mapping is many-to-one, not one-to-many.
<p>
    Having the "view" be clearly separated from the "model" and "controller" is nice, but only
    if you really can typically change the one without changing the other. I don't think that's
    the case when translating one high-level programming language to another. Is it really possible
    to capture the essence of a chunk of code (where "chunk" could be, for example, 5 lines of
    C code to be replaced by one indexOf() call), and store that essence in a data structure, and
    then convert that data structure to some output language?
    If we have a data structure that indicates "the C input was a pattern of code that can be
    replaced by a Java indexOf() call", then the design of that data structure is closely tied
    to Java. Having different "views" to display that data structure in various languages may not work.
</p>
<p>
Most importantly, any "separated view" design advantage must not be offset by a bigger disadvantage that
it may cause. The approach must really scale well to real
languages, as we'll discuss throughout this document. If everything becomes a mess in our
valiant attempts to completely separate the "view" from the "controller", then our gains may be offset
    by loses.
</p>

<h1>AST Structures</h1>
When looking at the advantages of StringTemplate, one assumption is that the structure of the
input and output language ASTs are similar. At first glance (and 2nd and 3rd, for that matter),
it seems like a C AST structure would be very similar to the equivalent Java AST structure. The python and bytecode
AST structures are surely less similar. But if we really want to generate "natural" Java
code, the AST will often be quite different from the C input. Let's take a simple example,
the classic C program:
<pre>
main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}
</pre>
...and the equivalent Java program:
<pre>
public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
</pre>
The ASTs for these two are in fact dramatically different. The
Java one has an extra "class" level, has extra "public", "static", and "void" keywords, only one argument, and a
different function call with a different argument. But beyond these differences, we can easily imagine
all sorts of other complications that will arise when we attempt to tackle just the C "main" function:
<ol>
<li>What are all the valid C "main()" function signatures that distinguish it from other "normal"
    functions that happened to be called "main"?
<li>What if the printf() had had a format string with lots of arguments of various types?
<li>How did we decide on "MyClass" for a class name? Did it match the file name, as required by Java?
<li>If the last thing that printf printed was something other than '\n', we'd use print() instead of println().
<li>How do we handle the C pointer syntax in general?
</ol>
<p>
If the goal really is to produce "natural" Java code and actually have the translator produce what's shown above,
then the "walk the AST and produce some simple output from each AST node" approach simply
does not work. We need for more processing logic and varied output than can be specified with simple
rules that fire at various AST nodes. That approach doesn't even scale up to the handling of the C main() function,
let alone all the vast complexities of real-world C programs.

<p>
If you're familiar with StringTemplate, you're probably thinking "Objection, your honor! I can do all those things
with StringTemplate!" But the issue is not whether it <b>can be done</b> or not (ignore my "does not work" wording above).
After all, you <b>could</b> do it
by hand-writing a lexer, parser, and translator in assembly language too. The issue is when you finish,
is what you've got using StringTemplates and AST walking better than what you'd have with some (unspecified here)
pattern-matching approach? Using StringTemplates, you'd have to do things like:
<ol>
<li>At any "main function" node, search below you in the AST for various patterns to see if this is
a "special main function" or just some function that happens to be called "main".
<li>At any "printf function" node, loop through the format string and arguments, and do lots of
processing to replace them with Java using the "+" operator.
<li>Look  for '\n' at the end of the format string to choose between println() and print().
<li>Use the current file name to produce the Java class name.
<li>Handle C pointers (left as an exercise for the reader who's looking for a PhD thesis topic).
</ol>
<p>
Now, obviously, you'd have to do all this processing with a pattern-matching" approach too, or any other approach
for that matter.
But the point here is that by the time you've written all that code to do all that processing, the advantages
of using a StringTemplate have become "lost". All the examples in the StringTemplate paper show
about 10 lines of parser-and-StringTemplate-builder code, and then a few lines of output code. But once you
scale it up from C- to C, you'd now have more like 10 lines of parser-and-StringTemplate-builder code,
 wrapping 1000 lines of code that's doing all this work. And the few lines of output code simply
 cannot be replaced. There is no way to say in just a few lines what a C printf() call looks like
 in Java. Only code that handles all the issues listed here (and more) will do.
 <p>
At the point where you've written all that code just to handle printf(),
you have to question whether the use of StringTemplate is really buying you anything. Since you're
going to be spending 98% of your time writing all that code that does all the "real work", is it really
worth the bother of having to learn yet another language (the "StringTemplate" language) to call your code?
Normally, it might not bother you to have to learn another programming language, but keep in mind that as you're
    developing a translator, you've got to keep both the source and target languages in your head at once.
    to also keep the ANTLR syntax, StringTemplate syntax, and AST tree structure in your head at the same time
    would become a huge burden. You want your focus to be on what needs to be done, not how to do it. You want
    to be spending your time determining what are all the C patterns that can be replaced with Java's indexOf(), not
    worrying about AST structures, ANTLR syntax, and StringTemplate usage.
    <p>
    Once the translator has grown past the "simple AST node replacements" stage, StringTemplate
is no longer doing what it was designed to do: have a simple specification of how to build something from an AST
that can easily be displayed in various ways. Most of that work is now being done by actual code written
in Java or some other language.
<p>StringTemplate may be fine when your translator mainly consists of dozens of small
"output this simple thing when you
encounter this type of node in the AST" rules. But when converting from C to ("natural") Java, what needs to be done is
not like that. It's more like hundreds of rules, each of which needs to
do some nontrivial processing, and has non-trivial output. We just saw how even
the processing for the simple printf() call is nontrivial, and we'll hit
similar complexity for many C library calls and
language constructs. At the high end of complexity, we have issues such as removing C pointers and removing
goto statements, in which StringTemplate is no help at all.</p>


<h1>Walking the AST</h1>
As mentioned earlier, the whole approach with StringTemplate and any other traditional translator is
to walk the AST and produce various output at various nodes. Indeed, the StringTemplate article says
<i>Usually there will be both a rule and template associated with each abstract language construct like
program, function, etc.</i> I have found In my experience in trying to produce "natural" Java
from C, that this is not true at all. You don't often find yourself in a situation where you say "I'm now at a node of
type <b>function</b> within the AST, so I need to output XYZ."
Some examples:
<ol>
    <li>When you encounter a "0" in C code, what's the Java equivalent? A
        "0", "null", "false", or something else? It all depends!

    <li>An "=" is just an assignment, right? What about if it's actually copying an entire C struct?
    What if it's assigning multiple fields of data to a C struct (which of course can't be done to a Java class)</li>
    <li>How do you replace the C "comma operator"? You may need to add braces.</li>
    <li>How do you replace the C "int" type "x" with a Java boolean type in "if (x)",
        keeping in mind that "x" may be any expression?</li>
</ol>
<p>
Just look at the "Hello, World" example again. What do we do when we encounter a node of type
<b>function</b>? Well, we'll do one thing with a printf() call, something else with a
read() call, a third thing for a call to getc(), and in fact, we'll end up with hundreds of
different things that we want to do for all the various calls to all the built-in libraries.
    <p>
And there are many cases where you want to look for <b>multiple</b> C tokens. For example, we may
want to replace a C strcasecmp() call with a Java equalsIgnoreCase() call, based on how it's used.
Here are some the Jazillian rules (on the left of "-->" is the C code pattern to match, on the
right is the Java replacement):
<pre>
strcasecmp(v1, v2) != 0 --> !v1.equalsIgnoreCase(v2)
strcasecmp(v1, v2) == 0 --> v1.equalsIgnoreCase(v2)
strcasecmp(v1, v2) --> v1.compareToIgnoreCase(v2)
</pre>
<p>
What about the function parameters? Doesn't most of the processing that we'll do
 on function parameters also apply to local and global variables? Yes, we could write all that
 code once and call it from multiple places in the grammar: formalParameters,
 globalVariables, and localVariables. But the question then becomes "what is StringTemplate buying you"?
 You'd end up with thousands of lines of code that build up some complex data structure, and your
 output specification would then be a mess to try to print that out. Or, you could have your
 code output the final code itself, in which case you no longer have the "separate View"
 advantage of StringTemplate. Either way, the advantage of StringTemplate has been lost.
<p>
    There are certainly many cases where AST-walking approach and StringTemplate would work well.
    Keywords that can simply be deleted, for example, or replacing "fprintf(stdout, ..." with
    just "printf(...", but these cases are actually the minority. And these cases can also be quite
    simply specified in whatever alternative approach is used. In Jazillian's pattern-matching
    system, for example, we simply say:
    <pre>
        const -->   // delete keyword const
        fprintf(stdout --> printf(
    </pre>
</p>

 <h1>HTML and CSS Analogy</h1>
 The situation here is analogous to that with HTML and CSS, and I don't just mean in the way CSS separates
the "view" from the "data". CSS is great because instead of embedding, say,
 "bold" tags inside every "code" tag, you can simply say "everything inside a "code" tag should be in bold",
and you say that in just one place.
 But if you're generating the HTML pages, and you have a 10,000 line program that generates all the
 HTML, you're surely going to have some sort of START_CODE_STRING constant anyway, and you can easily
 change that from "&lt;code&gt;" to "&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;". The only advantage that staying with CSS gives you is that
 the CSS could be changed later, after compile time, perhaps even by the person reading the page.
  <p>
 But there
 is no equivalent advantage (that I can see) in the StringTemplate case. Using StringTemplate to translate
      C to Java, you'd end up with a simple
 call to doEverythingRelatedToFunctionDeclarations() inside your parser, and a simple
 call to showWhateverWasProducedByThatOtherCall() as your output specification.
 <p>
 Another way to look at it is this. Suppose your generated HTML page is extremely dynamic - its look can vary
 completely based on the input. So you have a huge program that generates the HTML. Does it really matter whether
 the program generates the entire HTML page vs. having an HTML page that has one huge JSP tag? If you really can
    specify "the look" all in HTML, and "the data" is all generated, that's one thing. But when you're doing
    high-level language translation and your output is, say, Java code,
    there is no clear distinction between "a look" and "data". It's all just "code"! In the HTML-generating situation,
    by the
 time you're generating almost the whole page anyway, there's no advantage to even having a little bit of static
 HTML wrapping all that generated code. And if you're going to have 10,000 lines of code that handles
    converting any C function call to some equivalent
 Java code, then does it even make sense to have a "process
 all function calls here" architecture? It would make more sense to have hundreds of pattern-matching
 rules: one that replaces printf() calls, another that replaces read() calls, etc.

<h1>When Treewalking Doesn't Apply</h1>
Another problem with the AST treewalking approach is that many times, there is processing to be done that does
not correspond to a particular tree node. For example, a C function may have an "int" type and no return
statement, but the same Java function does need a return statement. At what node do we check for whether a function is
missing a return statement? We could put this check at the function declaration node, but then the code
is just going to have to search the children nodes for return statements anyway. You might think that we could
pass some data structure around that indicates whether we've seen a return statement or not. But that doesn't work, because it may
have one, but it's not at the end of the function. You need some nontrivial static control flow analysis to do it
right, but even to make any half-hearted attempt, you'll need far more than the simple
"at a node of type X, output Y" approach.
<p>
Here's another problem. Suppose we want to remove any function definitions
    for functions that are never called, and assume that we have
multiple input files. Yes, we could build an AST which contains multiple C source files ("translation units"),
and just do this sort of thing after all the treewalking is done. In a real C-to-Java translator, there will be many of these sorts of things. And
simply running all these checks at "the end" - after walking the whole tree - leaves you with a mixed
architecture; part of your work is being done with treewalking, and part is done at the end.
<p>
To give you a feel for the magnitude of the problem, here are some things that do not apply to any specific
AST node type that need to be done before treewalking(when translating C to Java):
<ol>
<li>Look for id's that are not C keywords but are Java keywords
<li>Handle all C preprocessor constructs (#define, #include, etc)
<li>Rename files
<li>Build up symbol tables
</ol>
And here are some that need to be done after treewalking:
<ol>
<li>Add needed "import" statements
<li>Add any required exception handling
<li>Remove unreachable code, unused variables and functions
</ol>

<h1>Scaling from C- to C</h1>
In this StringTemplate article, a hypothetical subset of C called "C-" is used to show examples. This makes
for nice, clean examples, and is great for giving an overview of how StringTemplate works. But it's not at all
clear that these examples would stay readable as we start adding the complexity of C. For example, in the
"Variable Declaration Translation" section, we see that a C- variable declaration has a simple, one-line
Java equivalent, a <b>very</b> simple zero-line Python equivalent, and even a simple two-line
bytecode equivalent. But what about when we start considering all the complexity of a real C declaration?
We hit all sorts of problems:
<ol>
<li>How do we convert C types to Java? The replacement for most C primitives depend on the hardware and/or
compiler. Does a "char *" become a Java String, or an array of chars? If it's an array of some non-primitive,
won't we have to add Java code to initialize it?
<li>Whenever we encounter a C variable declaration, don't we need to search for all references
 to it in other files, and prepend the class name to them, and change the declaration to make it public and
 static?
 <li>Shouldn't we check for variable shadowing, where one declaration of "i" is inside another? Because that's
 allowed in C, but not Java.
 <li>Can't the variable declaration also be an assignment, and we have to do all kinds of processing for that?
 <li>Don't we need to do some static code analysis to see if we need to turn the declaration into an assignment
 to avoid the Java "possible uninitialized variable" compiler warning?
 </ol>
 These are just problems related to variable declarations off the top of my head, there are probably others.
And, of course, variable declarations is just one tiny aspect of the whole language.
 <p>
 The point here is that by the time you add code to do all these checks, we no longer have a simple
 20-line spec for creating a StringTemplate and a one-line spec for producing an output. Instead, you'll
 have hundreds if not thousands of lines of code just to handle variable declarations!
     And even if you can manage to
 invoke that code with a few lines of code at the "variable declaration" point of the parser, you've replaced
 the "small bits of processing at each AST node" architecture with a "small bits of code that does all
 the work at each AST node" architecture. And the output specification is just no longer simple. There's
 just no getting around that. A simple variable declaration may end up with no changes, may end up with
 a different type, may end up having non-trivial initialization code added
     (possibly off in some static block), may even end up being deleted, all based on complex
 logic and many factors.

 <h1>Mixing languages is bad</h1>
 For me, the fundamental drawback to using StringTemplate is that I really don't want to have to learn yet
 another language beyond Java and ANTLR. It wouldn't be too bad, but the fact is that with StringTemplate,
 all three languages are mixed together. Here is a section of code from this StringTemplate article:
 <pre>
 function returns [StringTemplate code=template("function")]
 {StringTemplate t=null, f=null;}
    :   t=type id:ID {currentFunctionName=id.getText();} LPAREN
        (   f=formalParameter
            {code.setAttribute("args", f);}
            (   COMMA f=formalParameter
                {code.setAttribute("args", f);}
            )*
        )?

        RPAREN
        block[code]
        {
        code.setAttribute("type", t);
        code.setAttribute("name", id.getText());
        currentFunctionName=null;
        }
    ;
</pre>
This is a mix of Java, ANTLR, and StringTemplate syntax. This code is probably very
readable to ANTLR experts, but not me. I use ANTLR regularly and I would say I
"know ANTLR syntax pretty well", but I'm no expert, and I find the code above
to be quite difficult to read. I suppose it's not really fair for me to
say that this includes a "StringTemplate language",
as it's really just Java code that happens to use a Java class called StringTemplate. But you do
need to know how StringTemplate works in order to make sense of this code. I won't go into more detail
here about why I'm having so much trouble understanding the above code, other than to compare it
to the ANTLR parser rule without the StringTemplate stuff:
<pre>
parameterDeclaration
                            { String declName; }
        :       ds:declSpecifiers
                ( ( declarator[false] )=> declName = d:declarator[false]
                | nonemptyAbstractDeclarator
                )?
                {
                ## = #( #[NParameterDeclaration], ## );
                }
        ;
</pre>
If you're at the point (as I am) where you can barely understand this ANTLR syntax, throwing in the StringTemplate
 stuff just pushes you past your limit. It's not as if I didn't even try. Yes, I see how arguments
 are being passed and returned, I know how "id:ID" will create an "id" Token variable
 and where that is in the AST. I know LPAREN, COMMA, and RPAREN are lexer tokens. I can grasp
 that we'll declare a "code" variable of type StringTemplate, which seems to have a setAttribute
 method. I can even start to grasp that the "args" attribute must be some kind of list that's
 getting all the formal parameters. But in the end, my eyes gloss over and I just don't feel like
 I fully grok this code. I was teetering on the edge with the mix of ANTLR and Java syntax,
 and StringTemplate knocked me over the edge, and now I just feel stupid.

 <h1>Conclusion</h1>
 StringTemplates seem great for certain problem domains, but I don't think those domains are
 as large as this <a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=77">
 Language Translation Using ANTLR and StringTemplate</a> article makes them out to be. In fact, I don't think StringTemplates would
 scale well to the problem of translating from one high-level language (such as C) to
 another (such as Java) when the translation includes producing "natural" code that uses
library calls. What's more, I don't think the whole AST-walking approach scales well
 to that domain. The AST-walking approach works great for high-level to low-level translation
 (such as compilers). And StringTemplate seems great for simpler languages (such as this "C-" one and
maybe even ANTLR syntax),
 especially where the output AST structure will be similar to the input one. And by "similar" here,
 I'd even consider bytecode "similar". In that domain, StringTemplate seems like a reasonable tool,
and having multiple "views" that are distinct from the parser and translation logic is a nice bonus.
 <p>
 But there is now at least one tool (<a href="http://www.jazillian.com">Jazillian</a>) that translates
     from one high-level language (C) to another
 (Java) in which library calls are also translated and the output is "natural" code that looks hand-written. With that
 problem domain, the AST-walking architecture just doesn't work for much (maybe even most)
  of what needs to be done. The StringTemplate approach of having a simple specification for how to convert
  input to output for each type of AST node becomes a huge impediment, not an advantage. And the
  advantages that StringTemplates bring: separate "views" and a simple input-to-output
  specification language, get lost in a sea of code that implements all the functionality
  of translating C code to their "natural" Java equivalents.
