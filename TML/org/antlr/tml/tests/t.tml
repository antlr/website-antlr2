     Testing Lout Output

I'm testing some stuff here.

This is a date: %date

Heh, this should be an ol:

1 first item
  o nested list item one
  o nested list item two
1 second item at outer level

a normal paragraph terminates

#### Outer most big section

It can do paragraphs

and mroe paras {t=1;} and *bold* me _baby_

Is this a centered ting?

  "THis should
be centered"

back to normal paragraph

### nest header

stuff

### same level

## Level 3

para

#### Back out to main level header

stuff
