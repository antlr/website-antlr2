### Test of *TML* markup

  "Block quote man
is this big and cool or what?"

Paraggrfdsafdafds and this has a linke @http://www.antlr.org@ and a titled one
@http://www.antlr.org ANTLR HOME Web Site@ which is neato, man.


some final paragraph.

### Test the plugin stuff

Here is where we test plugins (path=%plugins)

%def(author, "Terence Parr")
%def(version, 1.2)

Now ref %date() and then %date(yesterday)

%include(~parrt/code/T.java)
%include(%author)

now that is cool.  Include plugin knows that .java is <<...>> block?
